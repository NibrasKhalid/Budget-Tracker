# Budget Tracker
Through the recording, classification, and summarization of their income and expenses, the "Budget Tracker" application is intended to assist users in managing their finances. The tool gives users an easy-to-use yet efficient approach to monitor their financial activity by storing and managing data using Excel files.

Key Features:
1. The date, category (either income or expense), description, and amount must be entered by the user when creating a new budget entry. To make sure the data is in the right format, the application validates the inputs.
2. A summary report that displays the total income, total expenses, and the remaining balance is available for users to view. This tool gives users a quick overview of their financial status.
3. By indicating the quantity of recurrence, users of the application can add recurring transactions, like monthly rent or paycheck. Based on the specified start date, every transaction is automatically logged for every month after that.
4. Users can generate detailed reports summarizing their income and expenses on a monthly and yearly basis. The reports are saved in a separate Excel file and automatically opened for the user to review. The application automates the opening of Excel files after updating or generating reports, making it easier for the user to access their data.
5. User can also access the budget tracker excel file remotely from the application.
